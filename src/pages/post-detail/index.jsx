Anxiety can make everything feel so much harder than it actually is. \n\nSomething that helped me in the beginning was starting with small steps - maybe calling a mental health hotline first, or even just talking to your regular doctor about how you're feeling. They can often provide referrals.\n\nAlso, remember that therapists are trained to help people who are struggling.

Don't let cost be a barrier if that's a concern.\n\nSending you so much support. You've got this! ðŸ’™`,
